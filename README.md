# FastKron

FastKron is a fast library for computing Generalized Kronecker-Matrix Matrix Multiplication (GeKMM) on NVIDIA GPUs and X86 CPUs.
FastKron contains a specialized algorithm and implementations of GeKMM rather than using existing linear algebra operations.
FastKron avoids extra transposes and adds more optimizations including fusion of multiple kernels.
Therefore, FastKron performs orders of magnitude better than baseline GPyTorch, NVIDIA cuTensor, and HPTT.
FastKron obtains upto 90% of the maximum FLOPs of a NVIDIA Tesla A100 and XX% of an AMD EPYC XXXX 64-Core with AVX512. 
FastKron supports float and double data type.
Fastkron provides a C++ library and a Python library compatible with PyTorch and Numpy.

# Example
The directory `example/` provides example for using FastKron's CUDA and x86 backend using both C++ and Python.
Before using an example, follow below instructions to build FastKron. 

# Build from scratch
Build the C++ library, libFastKron.so, to use with C++ programs or the Python library, PyFastKron, to use with PyTorch or Numpy programs.

### Required Pre-requisites
On Ubuntu :
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gcc linux-headers-$(uname -r) make g++ git python3-dev wget unzip python3-pip build-essential devscripts debhelper fakeroot intel-mkl cmake
```

### CUDA Pre-requisite
Install CUDA 11+ from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/ .

### Clone repository
Clone repository with submodules using 
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/abhijangda/fastkron.git
```

If already cloned and want to only clone submodules, use
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### libFastKron
Build FastKron as C++ library using below commands: 

```mkdir build/
cd build/
cmake ..
make -j
```

To install run
```make install```

By default both x86 and CUDA backends are built. use CMAKE option `-DENABLE_CUDA=OFF` to disable CUDA backend or `-DENABLE_X86=OFF` to disable x86 backend.

Run tests using 
```
make run_tests
```

### PyFastKron
Install PyFastKron using pip

```
pip install .
```

Run tests using 
```
pytest
```
