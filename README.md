# FastKron

FastKron is an efficient and fast library for Kronecker Matrix Matrix Multiplication on both Single GPU and Multi GPUs.
FastKron performs orders of magnitude better than GPyTorch by avoiding transpose of the shuffle algorithm.
FastKron obtains upto 85% of the maximum FLOPs of Tesla V100. 
FastKron supports several datatypes: float, double, int, float.

This repository provides the source code of FastKron, Makefile, test cases, and the API.
